We can use a named and default export to export a type in TypeScript.

```TypeScript
export type Some = { ... }

type More = { ... }
export default More
```

We import types like this:

```TypeScript
import DefaultType, {Some} from './types-file.ts'
```

## Named Export

Here is an example of exporting a type.
We can export type on the same line it was declared:

```TypeScript
// types-1.ts

// üëá named export
export type Some = {
  one: string
  two: number
}
```

{/* Note that using export on the same line as the type's definition is the same as exporting the type as an object after it has been declared. */}

We can export type after it has been declared:

```TypeScript
// types-2.ts

type Other = {
  three: string
  four: number
}

// üëá named export
export { Other }
```

Here is how we would import the types:

```TypeScript
// using-type-1.ts

// üëá named import
import { Some } from "./types-1"
import { Other } from "./types-2"

const some: Some = {
  one: "string",
  two: 2
}

const other: Other = {
  three: "string",
  four: 4
}
```

Make sure that all paths are right.
The example above assumes that all files are located in the same directory.

## Default Export

{/* For example, if you were importing from one directory up, you would do `import {Person} from '../another-file'`. */}

{/* We wrapped the name of the type in curly braces when importing it - this is called a named import. */}
TypeScript uses modules, in the same way that JavaScript does.

You can only import a type from a different file, if it has been exporting using named or default export.

You can have **as many named exports as you want** per file, but **only one default export** per file.

If you try to use multiple default exports in a file, you will get an error.

```TypeScript
// types-3.ts

type Some = {
  one: string
  two: number
}

//üëá default export
export default Some
```

```TypeScript
// types-4.ts

type Some = {
  one: string
  two: number
}

type More = {
  one: string
  two: number
}

//üëá default export

// ‚õîÔ∏è Error:
// A module cannot have multiple default exports.ts(2528)
export default Some
export default More
```

{/* ‚ùó IMPORTANT: */}
{/* If you are exporting a type, or a variable (or an arrow function) as a default export, */}
{/* you have to declare it on one line and export it on another. */}
{/* You can't declare and default export a variable on the same line. */}

{/* Let's look at an example that exports types and uses both - default and named exports. */}

## Using both: Default and Named export

Declaring types and exporting them as both: default and named export

```TypeScript
// types-5.ts

type Some = {how-to-export-impot-type-in-typescript
  one: string
  two: number
}

type More = {
  one: string
  two: number
}

//üëá default and named export in one line
export { Some as default, More }
```

Importing types:

```TypeScript
// using-type-3.ts

//üëá default and named import in one line
import DefaultType, { More } from "./types-5"

const some: DefaultType = {
  one: "string",
  two: 2
}

const other: More = {
  one: "string",
  two: 2
}
```

‚ùóNotice: we didn't wrap the default import in curly braces.

{/* We used a default import to import the Employee type and a named import to import the Person type. */}

{/* You can only have a single default export per file, but you can have as many named exports as necessary. */}

{/* In my experience, most real world codebases exclusively use named exports and imports, because they make it easier to leverage your IDE for autocompletion and auto-imports. */}
{/* You also don't have to think about which members are exported with a default or named export. */}
